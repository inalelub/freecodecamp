                <p>"I... I've been thinking every day since coming here. How did thngs turn out this way? Ruined minds and bodies.. People with no freedom left... People who have even lost themselves... What kind of person woul want to go to war if they knew they were going to end up like this? But... There was someting there, all along... pushing us right into hell. For most of us, that something is not our wn free will. We're forced to by others, or by our environment. That's why the people who push themselves into hell see a different hell from the rest of us. They also see something beyond that hell. Maybe it's hope. Maybe it's yet another hell. I don't know which it is. The only people who do know... are the ones who keep moving forward."</p>
